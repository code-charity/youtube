## Before 2016-07-30

Version 0.9.0 contains the new BETA version of jslint for EcmaScript 6,
which is a ground-up rewrite by Douglas Crockford.  The `latest` alias
still points to the last `es5` version of jslint; you can also use
`--edition=es5` to get the (old) es5 version.  To get the `es6` version
you must use `--edition=es6`.

Version 0.7.0 creates a new programmatic interface which is used by
https://github.com/hapijs/lab

Version 0.5.1 fixes a regression which crashes jslint when more than
maxerr errors are in a single file.  Thanks to Vasil Velichkov
(@velichkov) for pointing this out.

Version 0.5.0 reorganizes the loading interface, making it easier for
other projects to use node-jslint to load a specific jslint edition.

Version 0.4.0 exposes a stream interface to jslint.

Version 0.3.4 supports globbing with * and ** expressions.

Versions 0.2+ provide multiple editions of jslint to
address backwards and forwards compatibility.
