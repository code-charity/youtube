COMMENT /POSTAMBLE:
Reason for the specific restriction in 3.1.: 
   Some publishers use [our] code without permission commercially, with [excessive] adware/spyware. 
Together they can have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well. 
Thus we rationally/responsibly have to care. 
 - Despite the hope /tendency for smart behavior, to be superior on a long-term, as assumed by viral licences like GNU.  
(Marketing / competition / economy are just not fair in the present & billions of users might not review every software choice)
(And for this project we can't imagine, that requiring to ask first will hinder any good cause but only help /motivate /inspire each other)
