          - If the status is "closed" (=[fixed](https://github.com/code-for-charity/ImprovedTube-for-YouTube/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) very recently, then your Browser's store might update you soon /after [testing](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/wiki/Contributing#test).   
            - If it was already closed months/years ago, then youtube might change again. Then you can tag who fixed it last time ( @___ ) </i>
