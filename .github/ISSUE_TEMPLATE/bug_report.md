**2. To further increase our changes to solve the bug: Can you...?:**
      - ...deactivate other extensions running on YouTube?  (- Or use an incognito window after activating this extension to run there at chrome://extensions `details` or  chrome://extensions/?id=bnomihfieiccainjcjblhegjgglakjdd)
    -  ...open the Browser-console, with the `F12`-Key, before/when the error occures?  (then hopefully you'll see an error message in the console). 
      -  ...copy the YouTube-DOM shown above the console  (`F12`) in case YouTube is giving you a new verson.  You can copying the root element `<html>` in the top after the bug happened:
